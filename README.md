# Kasa – OC Project 06 🏡 (Creative remix)

React-powered apartment rental platform for a major French player in peer-to-peer housing.

---

## 🚀 Project context

This project was born from a freelance front-end dev mission with **Kasa**, a heavyweight in the French rental market with 500+ listings posted daily. They needed a full React revamp, ditching their old ASP.NET codebase for a fresh JavaScript stack (React front-end, Node.js back-end incoming).

My role? Build the entire front-end from scratch, starting with React components and React Router navigation, strictly following the designer’s Figma mockups, pixel-perfect and responsive across devices.

**Heads up: There are actually two versions here.**  
One matches the evaluation requirements exactly, the official mockups, design specs, and functional expectations.  
The other is a personal rework where I tweaked styles, UI details, and interaction flows to better match *my own tastes* and push the UX just a bit further.  
Both are fully functional React apps, but the second shows my creative spin beyond the brief.

## ⚠️ Design Disclaimer

**I didn’t design this.** The Figma mockups, structure, and UX were provided as part of the mission.  
If something feels off in spacing, color balance, or layout, it’s not me, it’s the spec 😅  
My job here was to *integrate everything faithfully* and build a scalable, component-driven React front-end, not to reinvent the visual language.

**Evaluation Highlights:**

- ✅ Modular React components  
- ✅ Clean routing with React Router v6  
- ✅ 404 and dynamic error handling implemented  
- ✅ Gallery & collapse behavior match functional specs  
- ✅ Sass used correctly for component styling  
- ✅ TypeScript for clarity & structure  
- ✅ Bonus points for using `props.children` creatively

**Areas for improvement:**

- 🔄 Push code updates more frequently to improve version tracking
